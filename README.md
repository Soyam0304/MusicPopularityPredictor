Music Popularity Prediction

Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features and metadata. By leveraging regression techniques, the model forecasts a song's future performance in terms of streams, downloads, and chart positions, aiding music producers, artists, and marketers in making informed decisions.

Project Goals
Develop a machine learning model to estimate music popularity.
